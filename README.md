# Nik's Google Docs Templates 
*For Google Workspace*

Welcome to Nik’s Google Docs Templates
This add-on makes it easy to build Google Docs out of other docs and images.

Great for templating, quickly inserting commonly used text, or creating document frameworks, rather than whole templates.

## Configure the Add-On
1. Create templates of docs and images in a folder in your Google Drive
1. Supports Google Docs files as well as images
1. Copy the URL of your folder
1. Set the folder in the add-on

## Browsing Files and Folders
1. Browse any docs and images in the Drive folder you’ve selected
1. Easily navigate between folders

## Insert Assets into Your Document
1. Put your cursor in your document where you want to insert the template
1. Select a document template
1. Use the ✅button to insert the template 

*NOTE: Some Google Docs formatting aren’t supported, those files cannot be used as templates*

## Add Descriptions to your Documents
1. Click the 💬 to add a useful description to any template or asset
1. That description will appear when you click on the document or image
1. These are saved in a file in your Google Drive folder named `.nik-template-info.json`, this lets you save your descriptions with anyone who has access to the folder, so don't delete it!

## Other Features and Shortcuts
1. In the three-dot-menu, you can create new templates for insertion from within the add-on without going to Google Drive
1. You can also reload the folder to immediately update contents
1. And finally, you can reset the source folder if you want to change where your template files are location
1. To access help, go to the Extensions menu, there is also a reset option there

## Support
1. This is a little utility created by a decidedly bad developer, use at your own risk
1. Feel free to leave issues here in GitHub, but I cannot guarantee a response
2. Pull requests are also welcome

## Policies
1. This is released under a very permissive open source license, you can basically use it however you like. (See the LICENSE file for details)
2. This app does not track any information, have any analytics, or save any of your information to the cloud. It just runs on your own computer.

Code was written by a crappy developer with the assistance of AI. There be dragons. Shouldn't be anything destructive, but always back up your files.
