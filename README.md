# Nik's Google Docs Templates 
*For Google Workspace*

This is a Google Workspace™ add-on which lets you insert Google Docs files within your Google Drive™ into an existing document, thereby giving you modular templates to build files from.

You can also add extra information to those files to make them more descriptive and easier share with colleagues.

Should be easy enough to use.

Due to how Google's™ programming limits copying contents of files, certain embedded items or complex formatting may be lost.

Feel free to leave issues here if you run into problems. No guarantees on support turnaround.

Code was written by a crappy developer with the assistance of AI. There be dragons. Shouldn't be anything destructive, but always back up your files.
