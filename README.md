# Nik's Google Docs Templates 
*For Google Workspace*

This add-on makes it easy to build a library of docs and images and quickly insert them into Google Docs.

*__NOTE:__* Some Google Docs formatting arenâ€™t supported, those files cannot be used as templates*

## Add Descriptions to your Documents
1. Click the ðŸ’¬ to add a useful description to any template or asset
1. That description will appear when you click on the document or image
1. These are saved in a file in your Google Drive folder named `.nik-template-info.json`, this lets you save your descriptions with anyone who has access to the folder, so don't delete it!

## Other Features and Shortcuts
1. In the three-dot-menu, you can create new templates for insertion from within the add-on without going to Google Drive

## Support
1. There is a known issue with multi-tab pageless documents, this seems to be a Google API limitation
1. Feel free to leave issues here in GitHub, but I cannot guarantee a response
2. Pull requests are also welcome
3. **Warning:** Code was written by a crappy developer with the assistance of AI. There be dragons. Shouldn't be anything destructive, but always back up your files.
